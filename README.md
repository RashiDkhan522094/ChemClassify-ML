# ChemClassify: Predicting Chemical Categories with Machine Learning

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to classify chemical data into categories.  
It includes:
- Data preprocessing  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Visualizations (class distribution & confusion matrix)  
- A simple predictive system  

## Files
- `ChemClassify_Predicting_Chemical_Categories.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full workflow  
- `chem_data.csv` → Dataset used for training & testing  

## Results
The model achieves good accuracy on test data, showing the potential of ML in cheminformatics.
